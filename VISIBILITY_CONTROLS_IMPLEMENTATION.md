# Controlled Visibility Modes Implementation

## Overview
The Controlled Visibility Modes feature has been successfully implemented to provide sellers with the option to limit listing visibility to peers within their own university or open it up to all registered students across participating institutions.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Type Definitions (`src/types/listing.d.ts`)
- Added `VisibilitySettings` interface with:
  - `mode`: 'university' | 'all_students'
  - `allowedUniversities`: Optional array for university-specific visibility
  - `description`: Optional description for the visibility setting
- Updated `Listing` interface to include `visibilitySettings?: VisibilitySettings`

### 2. Visibility Controls Component (`src/components/marketplace/VisibilityControls.tsx`)
A new reusable component that provides:
- **University Only Mode**: Limits visibility to students from the seller's university
- **All Students Mode**: Makes listings visible to all verified students across institutions
- Visual indicators with icons (University/Globe)
- Color-coded badges for easy identification
- Informational descriptions explaining each mode
- Contextual help text based on the selected mode

### 3. Edit Listing Page (`src/pages/EditListing.tsx`)
Enhanced with:
- Import of VisibilityControls component
- State management for visibility settings
- User university fetching from Firebase
- Integration of visibility controls in the sidebar
- Form submission updated to save visibility settings

### 4. Create Listing Page (`src/pages/CreateListing.tsx`)
Enhanced with:
- Import of VisibilityControls component
- State management for visibility settings with default 'all_students' mode
- User university fetching on component mount
- Integration of visibility controls in the sidebar
- Form submission updated to include visibility settings

## Features Implemented

### Visibility Modes
1. **University Only Mode**
   - Restricts listing visibility to students from the seller's university
   - Automatically sets `allowedUniversities` to the seller's university
   - Displays blue-themed UI with university icon
   - Provides clear explanation of the restriction

2. **All Students Mode**
   - Makes listings visible to all verified students across participating institutions
   - Default mode for new listings

### Data Storage
- Visibility settings are stored in the `visibilitySettings` field of each listing

## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [visibilitySettings, setVisibilitySettings] = useState<VisibilitySettings>({
  mode: 'all_students'
});
const [userUniversity, setUserUniversity] = useState<string>('');
```

### University Detection
- Fetches user's university from Firebase user profile
- Used to automatically configure university-only mode
- Displays university name in visibility descriptions

### Form Integration
- Visibility controls integrated into both Create and Edit listing forms
- Positioned in the sidebar for easy access
- Settings persist when switching between modes
