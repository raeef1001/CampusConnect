## üöÄ Getting Started

There are a few ways to get started with developing or contributing to CampusConnect:

### 1. Use your preferred IDE (Local Development)

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository. Replace <YOUR_GIT_URL> with the actual Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory. Replace <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME> with your project's folder name.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running, typically at `http://localhost:5173` (Vite's default) or as specified in your console.

### 2. Edit a file directly in GitHub

*   Navigate to the desired file(s) in the repository.
*   Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
